    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>

    <div class="card">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">1. How does the complaint workflow operate?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The complaint workflow begins when a user submits a complaint through the system.
          The complaint is automatically recorded and assigned an initial status.
          Administrators then review the submitted details, verify the information, and decide
          on the appropriate action. Throughout the process, admins update the complaint status
          until the issue is fully resolved. This structured workflow ensures transparency,
          accountability, and efficient handling of all complaints.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">2. What complaint statuses are available in the system?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The system provides several complaint statuses to reflect the progress of each case.
          These include Pending for newly submitted complaints, Approved for validated cases,
          In Progress for complaints currently being handled, and Resolved for completed cases.
          These statuses help administrators track progress clearly and maintain an organized workflow.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">3. Where can admins update or modify complaint details?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Admins can update or modify complaint details through the Data Entry section of the system.
          This includes editing descriptions, updating complaint status, adding administrative remarks,
          or assigning staff for action. Any updates made are saved immediately to ensure the most
          accurate and up-to-date information is available at all times.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">4. How is system performance measured in the dashboard?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          System performance is measured by analyzing the ratio of resolved complaints compared
          to the total number of complaints recorded. This performance indicator provides admins
          with a quick overview of operational efficiency and resolution effectiveness.
          A higher performance percentage indicates faster and more efficient complaint handling.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">5. Can multiple administrators manage complaints at the same time?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, the system supports multiple administrators accessing and managing complaints
          simultaneously. All updates are synchronized in real time, allowing admins to work
          collaboratively without data conflicts. This feature ensures smooth operations,
          especially when handling a large volume of complaints.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">6. Can admins generate and print complaint reports?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Admins can generate detailed complaint reports from the Full Report section.
          These reports can be filtered by date, status, or device type, and then printed
          or exported for documentation, audits, or management meetings.
          This feature supports transparent reporting and informed decision-making.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">7. What should an admin do if incorrect data is entered?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          If incorrect data is identified, admins should promptly update and correct the
          information using the Data Entry page. Maintaining accurate records is critical
          for reliable reporting, proper decision-making, and system integrity.
          All corrections should be verified before saving to prevent recurring errors.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">8. Are admin actions recorded in the system?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, the system records key administrative actions such as status updates,
          approvals, and modifications. These logs provide accountability and allow
          administrators to review previous actions if needed.
          This ensures transparency and supports auditing processes.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">9. How does the system support daily administrative operations?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The system supports daily operations by providing a centralized dashboard with
          real-time data, complaint summaries, and performance indicators.
          These features allow admins to monitor progress, prioritize tasks,
          and respond efficiently to new complaints, improving overall workflow management.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">10. How are resolved complaints handled in the system?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Once a complaint has been resolved, it is marked as Resolved and remains stored
          in the system for future reference. Resolved complaints can still be viewed
          in reports and historical records, allowing admins to analyze trends
          and improve future service quality.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">11. Can admins manually add complaints into the system?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, admins are able to manually add complaints through the Data Entry section.
          This is particularly useful when users are unable to submit complaints themselves
          or when complaints are received through alternative channels such as phone calls
          or in-person reports.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">12. What happens when a complaint is approved?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          When a complaint is approved, it confirms that the reported issue has been verified
          and accepted for action. The complaint then moves to the processing stage,
          where appropriate steps are taken to resolve the issue.
          This ensures only valid complaints proceed through the system.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">13. Can admins review previous actions taken on a complaint?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Yes, admins can review the complete history of a complaint, including all previous
          updates, status changes, and remarks. This detailed record helps admins understand
          the progression of each case and supports accurate follow-up actions.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">14. How does the system help reduce response time?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          The system reduces response time by offering real-time updates, clear status tracking,
          and filtering tools. These features enable admins to quickly identify new or urgent
          complaints and respond promptly, leading to faster resolutions
          and improved service efficiency.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">15. How should admins properly end their session?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Admins should always sign out using the Sign Out option after completing their tasks.
          This prevents unauthorized access and helps maintain system security.
          Logging out is especially important when accessing the system
          from shared or public devices.
